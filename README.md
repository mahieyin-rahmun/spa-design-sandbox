### Note about this repository

I created this repository to get some practice done in HTML and CSS along with responsive UI design in the context of React, particularly Next.js. 

The projects in this repository are merely client side implementations of SPAs and are to serve as demos only. They are **NOT** hooked to a backend of any sorts, but ocassionally they may call third-party APIs.
